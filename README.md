# Ruby
Notes on the Ruby language, for future access and help for Chess, because they are forgetful and not very good.
Continually updated and maintained, as errors are fixed as they are spotted, usually, and new bits of knowledge (and old ones Chess
forgot they already wrote down) are added as they are thought of.
